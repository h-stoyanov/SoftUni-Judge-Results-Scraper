# SoftUni Judge Results Scraper
This is helping me to get my students results from SoftUni's judge system.
To use it you have to:
1. Add students usernames to the src/main/resouces/students.xlsx
2. Add lectures (courses) with their ID and Max points
3. Add your personal cookies (you can get them from the browser)
4. Compile and run the program and enter the course name
5. Wait the scraper to do it's job and after he is done you will have the students result in decimal format from 0 to 6
